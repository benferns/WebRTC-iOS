Sure, here's a brief annotation for each section of your SDP:

v=0: This is the protocol version. 0 is the only version currently defined by the IETF.

o=- 5930842292085691355 4 IN IP4 127.0.0.1: Originator and session identifier. This contains the user's username, the session ID, the version number, the network type, address type, and address.

s=-: Session name, "-" denotes no session name.

t=0 0: Timing information. Here, both the start and stop times are set to 0, indicating the session is not bounded by time.

a=group:BUNDLE 0 1 2: This session attribute is for bundling. It means that all media types (audio, video, data) will use the same transport (same IP, port).

a=extmap-allow-mixed: Session level attribute indicating that mixed RTP and RTCP packets are allowed on the same port.

a=msid-semantic: WMS stream: This attribute ties media streams together that form a higher-level stream (e.g., left and right eye in a 3D video call).

m=video 62479 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96 97 98 99 100 101 127 103 35 36 104 105 106: Media description. This line describes a media stream, in this case, a video stream. The stream will use a port of 62479 and the protocols UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF. The numbers that follow are the payload type identifiers.

a=rtcp:9 IN IP4 0.0.0.0: This attribute specifies the port (9) for RTCP traffic and the network type and address type (IP4) for the connection.

a=candidate...: The SDP candidate attribute provides information about a potential connectivity path for media. Each candidate line includes a unique identifier, transport protocol, priority, IP address, port, candidate type, and more.

a=ice-ufrag and a=ice-pwd: These attributes provide the ICE username fragment and password, which are used to authenticate STUN requests.

a=ice-options:trickle renomination: This attribute suggests options for ICE to use. "Trickle" means ICE candidates can be gathered incrementally, and "renomination" allows the ICE agent to change the selected pair after initially choosing it.

a=fingerprint:sha-256: This attribute carries the fingerprint of the DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) certificate, which is used for secure communication.

a=setup:actpass: This attribute indicates the DTLS role that the agent is prepared to take. "Actpass" means the agent can be either the active or passive role.

a=mid:0: This attribute is the identification-tag for the media description. It matches the labels used in the BUNDLE attribute.

a=extmap...: These attributes specify RTP header extensions, which provide a way to include additional information in RTP packets.

a=sendrecv: This attribute indicates the direction of the media stream; in this case, the stream can be both sent and received.
